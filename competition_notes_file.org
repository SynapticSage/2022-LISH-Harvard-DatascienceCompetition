+ ~1~ - the waterpoint needs repairs

** **Predictors**:
*** [#C] ~amount_tsh~ -  Total static head (amount water available to waterpoint)
*** [#A] ~date_recorded~ - The date the row was entered
*** [#A] ~funder~ - Who funded the well
*** ~gps_height~ - Altitude of the well
*** [#A] ~installer~ - Organization that installed the well
*** [#A] ~longitude~ - GPS coordinate
*** [#A] ~latitude~ - GPS coordinate
*** Geographic subgroups
*** ~population~ - Population around the well
*** [#C] ~wpt_name~ - Name of the waterpoint if there is one
*** ~basin~ - Geographic water basin
*** ~subvillage~ - Geographic location
*** ~region~ - Geographic location
*** ~region_code~ - Geographic location (coded)
*** ~district_code~ - Geographic location (coded)
*** ~lga~ - Geographic location
*** ~ward~ - Geographic location
*** ~public_meeting~ - True/False
*** [#A] _DROPPABLE COLUMNS_
**** ~recorded_by~ - Group entering this row of data
*** [#A] ~scheme_management~ - Who operates the waterpoint
*** [#A] ~scheme_name~ - Who operates the waterpoint
*** ~permit~ - If the waterpoint is permitted
*** ~construction_year~ - Year the waterpoint was constructed
*** ~extraction_type~ - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
*** ~extraction_type_group~ - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
*** ~extraction_type_class~ - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
*** ~management~ - How the waterpoint is managed
*** ~management_group~ - How the waterpoint is managed
*** ~payment~ - What the water costs
*** ~payment_type~ - What the water costs
*** [#A] Water quality group
two more names for water_quality over quality_group
**** ~water_quality~ - The quality of the water
**** ~quality_group~ - The quality of the water
*** [#A] ~quantity~ - The quantity of water
quantity group is the same
**** ~quantity_group~ - The quantity of water
literal repeat
*** [#A] Source vars
Different vars
**** ~source~ - The source of the water
**** ~source_type~ - The source of the water
*** ~source_class~ - The source of the water
*** ~waterpoint_type~ - The kind of waterpoint
Has fewer splits than the above
**** ~waterpoint_type_group~ - The kind of waterpoint
